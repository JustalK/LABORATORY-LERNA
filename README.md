# LABORATORY-LERNA

A small test for testing what is **learna**.
Lerna is the original monorepo tool for TypeScript/JavaScript but it has been taken over **NX** that I recommend.

For now this project will be archived since Learna has not too much to give compare to NX.
If a project is under Lerna, I will advice to migrate to NX.
